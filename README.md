Features
--------
- Clears private data on close
- Blocks access to Google trackers and other third-party resources
- Restricts all network requests to HTTPS
- Allows toggling of location permission

Downsides
---------
- Navigation is not available, only turn-by-turn direction list
- WebRTC isn't blocked due to WebView limitations
- Cache isn't cleared due to resource/data considerations, however could allow tracking without other data (cookies)
